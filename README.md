# 🔥 Birds and Fire 

Birds and Fire is a simple game inspired by the classic Space Invaders, except there's no spaceships, just a Dragon (the player) trying to burn as many seagulls as it can before it gets egg-bombed to death.

## ℹ️ Instructions 

Move using the arrow keys, use Q to shoot. Being hit by an egg will kill you but hitting a seagull won't.

### 🚨 Known issues 🚨

- Pressing space after the game has started will cause everything to speed up and break, to prevent this press another button or click somewhere else in the screen.

- The game is blocked for screens smaller than 800 pixels in width, this is done on purpose as it wouldn't work well at all in screens narrower than that.
